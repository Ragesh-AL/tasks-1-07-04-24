            <h3 class="h3tag">Bruce lee</h3>
            <p>Bruce Lee, an iconic figure in martial arts and film, is celebrated for his profound influence on the
                world of martial arts and his trailblazing roles in cinema. Born in San Francisco and raised in Hong
                Kong, Lee's dynamic fighting style and philosophy transformed martial arts from a traditional practice
                into a modern art form. As the founder of Jeet Kune Do, he advocated for adaptability, efficiency, and
                personal expression, challenging the rigid conventions of traditional martial arts. Lee's films, such as
                "Enter the Dragon" and "The Way of the Dragon," became cultural landmarks, breaking down barriers and
                showcasing martial arts on a global stage. Beyond his physical prowess, Lee's wisdom and philosophy
                continue to inspire generations, reminding us that the true essence of martial arts lies in
                self-improvement, discipline, and the courage to break boundaries. His legacy endures as a symbol of
                innovation, strength, and the relentless pursuit of excellence.

            <h3 class="h3tag1">Bruce Lee the Actor</h3>
            <p>Bruce Lee's approach to martial arts was revolutionary, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and
                practical application. He famously stated, "Be water, my friend," underscoring his belief that martial
                arts should be fluid and flexible, not confined by rigid traditions. This philosophy led him to create
                Jeet Kune Do, a system that combined elements from various martial arts to form a highly efficient and
                versatile fighting style. Lee's emphasis on "using no way as way" and "having no limitation as
                limitation" encouraged practitioners to think beyond conventional boundaries and to adapt to any
                situation.</p>
